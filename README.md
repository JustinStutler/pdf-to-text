Have you ever needed the text data from a pdf, but the pdf will not let you copy and paste? 
The solution is right here - Using pytesseract and filetoimage libraries in Python, we can convert the pdf to an image and then extract the text data using pytesseract's OCR (Optilcal Character Recognition).
The text data is saved into a new textfile stored in the project folder.

All the user has to do is:
1. drag a pdf file into the folder
2. copy the file name into the name variable
3. save and run the code
